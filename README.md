# Introduction

The Open Threat Modeling Format (OTM) defines a platform independent way to define the threat model of any system.

OTM allows both humans and computers to understand what are the components of a system, how are they distributed, the security risks that could be exposed to attackers and the mitigations that could be implemented to avoid those vulnerabilities.

OTM can be used to document your system and threat model, to keep you threat model aware of the changes that happens in the system and many other use cases.

# Complete example

For a complete example see [EXAMPLE.yaml](EXAMPLE.yaml) or [EXAMPLE.json](EXAMPLE.json).

# Versions

The Open Threat Model specification is versioned using [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (semver) and follows the semver specification.

```
Current schema version: 0.1.1
```

# Format

An OTM document is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**. This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map.

The specification follows the same approach to JSON formats as the OpenAPI specification. See https://swagger.io/specification/ for more information.

# Data Types

Primitive data types in the OTM are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Wright Draft 00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00#section-4.2). Note that `integer` as a type is also supported and is defined as a JSON number without a fraction or exponent part. `null` is not supported as a type (see `nullable` for an alternative solution).

The formats available to be used within an OTM files are:

| Type       | Comment                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `integer`  | signed 32 bits                                                                                            |
| `long`     | signed 64 bits (a.k.a long)                                                                               |
| `float`    |                                                                                                           |
| `double`   |                                                                                                           |
| `string`   |                                                                                                           |
| `richText` | Rich text fields are noted as supporting CommonMark markdown formatting.                                  |
| `boolean`  |                                                                                                           |
| `date`     | As defined by full-date - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) |
| `datetime` | As defined by date-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) |

## Project object

The project node represents the entity within all the other elements are grouped. Its the unit of work.

  owner: John Doe
  ownerContact: john.doe@example.com
  attributes:
    filePath: “file.xml”
    cmdbId: MyApp123
```

## Representations object

This node can define several ways on which the project can be represented.

Representation is an abstract concept and there might be several implementations.

These are the currently supported representation types:

- `diagram`
- `code`
- `threat-model`

Each representation has these fields:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>string</td>
<td><b>REQUIRED</b> Name for the representation.</td>
<td>

    name: Architecture diagram

</td>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>string</td>
<td><b>REQUIRED</b> Unique identifier for the representation.</td>
<td>

    id: architecture-diagram-id

</td>

    type: diagram

</td>

<tr></tr>

    description: This is a diagram of the project's architecture

</td>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>attributes</td>
<td>Map [string, string]</td>

<td>

    attributes:
        language: java
        platform: github
        vcs: git

</td>
</tr>

</table>
<br />

#### Example

```yaml
representations:
  - name: Architecture Diagram
    id: architecture-diagram
    description: This is a diagram of the project's architecture
    type: diagram
    size:
      width: 1000
      height: 1000
    attributes:
      platform: drawio
      unit: pixel
  - name: Application Code
    id: application-code
    type: code
    repository:
      url: https://github.com/my-project
    attributes:
      language: java
      platform: github
      vcs: git
```

## Representation supported types

Depending on the type selected, some extra fields must be included in the representation. The supported representation types are:

### Diagram

Represents a diagram with very basic information.

Under the type “diagram“ we have the following extra fields:

| Field | Type                        | Description                                                                  | Examples |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| size  | [Size object](#size-object) | **REQUIRED** Object that contains the information regarding the diagram size |          |

#### Example

```yaml
representations:
  - name: Architecture Diagram
    id: architecture-diagram
    description: This is a diagram of the project's architecture
    type: diagram
    size:
      width: 1000
      height: 1000
    attributes:
      background-color: blue
      transparent: 40
```

### Code

Represents a repository of code.

Under the type “code“ we have the following extra fields:

| Field      | Type                                    | Description                                                                    | Examples |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| repository | [Repository object](#repository-object) | Contains information about the Repository where the referenced code is located |          |

#### Example

```yaml
representations:
  - name: Application Code
    id: application-code
    type: code
    repository:
      url: https://github.com/my-project
    attributes:
      language: java
      framework: spring
```

### Threat-Model

Represents a threat model.

Under the type “threat-model“ we have no extra fields.

#### Example

```yaml
representations:
  - name: Architecture Threat Model
    id: architecture-threat-model
    type: threat-model
    attributes:
      source: Microsoft Threat Model
      template: custom
```

## RepresentationElement object

The representation element stated how an element is represented with the available representations.

In the current version we support three types of representation types as was mentioned here [OTM version 0.1.0 | Representations-object](#representations-object):

- diagram
- code
- threat-model

Therefore, there can be also three types of representation instances:

### Representation element for diagram

Represents an element of a diagram.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>representation</td>
<td>string</td>
<td><b>REQUIRED</b> Id of the representation on which this element is represented</td>
<td>

    representation: architecture-diagram

</td>
</tr>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Name for the representation element.</td>
<td>

    name: Component Box

</td>
</tr>

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>id</td>

    id: component-box-id

</td>
</tr>

<tr></tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
</tr>

<tr></tr>

<td>This is a free-form map of attributes that complete the description of the representation.</td>
<td>

    attributes:
      color: red
      shape: square

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>

#### Example

```yaml

## AssetRisk object

AssetRisk influences impact with regard to a threat.

Those values are passed through OTM into the IR rules engine which performs the calculation for inherent risk.
